          <h3>Software</h3>
          <p>
            Becoming an IT professional is my primary goal! My current studies
            include Python, Web-Development and SQL databases. In the coming
            term I will be learning OOP with C#, machine learning and algorithms
            and data structures. I am also interested in low-level programming
            and hardware! Actively seeking career opportunities in
            Cloud/Application Development or Software Development, and customer
            support roles.

          <h3>Combat Engineer</h3>
          <p>
            In the Army my job was a 12B (Combat Engineer). During my service I
            spent time in South Korea, learning to work with their military and
            navigate their culture. My time in the army gave me a new
            understanding of how to approach work and work on teams. My top
            skills that I gained in the Army are leadership and how to stay
            mission focused.
